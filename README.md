# Simple Caesar Cipher in Ruby
Made for the Ruby course in The Odin Project.

## Assignment instructions
Implement a Caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string using a right shift:
```ruby
> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
=> "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
```

My version can also take a negative number and do a left shift.
